of Alcuin the work of a man not unaequainted with
melody and numbers, who could express his meaning
with facility, either in prose or verse.

The poem was first printed by Mabillon (Acta SS. Ord.
S. Ben. iii. pt. ii.‚ 503-14) from a MS. in the monastery
of St„ Theodoric, near RheimS, discovered for him by
Christopher Daubin. The title of the MS. was “ Historia
‘⁶ Anglica Carmine Heroico a quodam sapiente facta‚”
and, strange to say, the learned Benedictine failed to
recognise the authorship of the poem. He also omits
the greater part of it (ll. 99-1215) on the plea that it
was merely between those limits a metrica] paraphrase
of Bede, and on that account of no historical importance.
It was certainly worthy of better treatment.

The next editor was Gale, in the first volume of whose
Collection of Historians (pp. 701-732) it appears.⁴ It'
came to Gale from Mabillon: ‘⁴ hoc poema beneficio viri
‘⁴ doctissimi J. Mabillonii accepi, quod gratissimo ore
“ profiteor,’' and he recognised what his learned friend
had failed to see, that it was the work of Alcuin to
whom he unhesitatingly ascribed it. Gale derived his
text from two Mss„ one at St. Theodoric near Rheims‚
and 'the other at Rheims itself.

The next edition is that by the learned Froben in. his
collected works of Alcuin (Vol. ii„ ed. 1777, pp. 241-58).

He professes to get his text from the MS. at St. Theodoric. .

The poem is edited with the customary skill of that
great scholar, with valuable prolegomena and notes

The poem has been reprinted in Migne’s Patrologia„ ci„
813 et seqq.

The last and the best edition is that published at
Berlin in 1873, in 8v0. in the sixth volume of the Bib-
liotheca Rerum Germanicarum (pp. 78-131). It was
prepared by Philip J affe, after whose lamented decease
it was finished and published by W. wattenbach and
