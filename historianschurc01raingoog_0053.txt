men of that country, Oswald made a new shrine, in
which “ tam celeberrimi posuit praesulis membra.

It is plain from this that in the opinion of the writer
the bones were those of Wilfrid senior, the great bishop.

Nothing is said of any previous translation of his remains The differ·
by Od0, and yet Oswald was Odo’s nephew‚ and his enee ΒΘ·

biographer would have known, we should have thought, &gage-the
of the event if it had occurred3 indeed, supposing that he ⁰⁰¹²¹²t⁸·
had any strong feeling in the matter, as a monk of
Ramsey his bias would have been in favour of Canter-

bury rather than Ripon. Nothing also is said by him
about the removal of what was found to Worcester;
indeed from the mention of the great eoncourse on the

spot to witness the translation, it- is plain that such a
removal would neither have been tolerated nor thought

of. There is a strong presumption that Eadmer was
acquainted with this striking passage in Oswald’s life, =
but he makes an inscription, to which a strong exception

can be taken, and gives a conveniently different account

Of the position of the bones. He also makes wilfrid
junior a saint who was not canonized, and certainly
unworthy of that honour according to Bede.

The location of Wilffid’s remains at Canterbury is ffiffie
mentioned in a most curious passage from the Life of Life of St·
St. Audoenus, which proceeded from Eadmer's pen, and affigffius,
is found in a ns, at, Cambridge which is devoted to his tzae poff
works.l , ξέν’ῑῖᾧῖινθ
