The authorahip of the Chronicle in Vol. 1., hitherto ascribed to Geofl'rey
V‘meeauf, is now more correctly ascribed to Richard, Canon of the Holy Trinit5
of London. The narrative extends from 1187 10 1199; but ite chief interest
consiste in the minute and authentic narrative which it furnishea of the exploits
of Richard 1„ from his departure from England in December 1189 10 hia death
in 1199. The author stateo in hir prologne that he was an eye-witness of much
that he recorda ς and various incidental circumstances which occur in the course
of the narrative confirm thie asserum.

The lettera in Vol. Π., written between 1187 and 1199, are of value aa
surniahing authentic materiale for the history of the ecclesiastical condition of
England during the reign ofRichard 1. They had their origin in a dispute which
arose from the attempt· of Baldvin and Hubert, archbiahop· of Canterbury, to
found a college of eecnlar canona, a proiect which gave great umbi-age to the
monka of Canterbnry, 11110 sav in it a deeign to supplent them in their sanction
of metropolitan chapter. 'rheae lettera are printed, for the first time, from a MS.
belonging to the archiepiscopal library at Lambeth.
