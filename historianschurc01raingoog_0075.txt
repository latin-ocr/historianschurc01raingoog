volume is now bound in two parts and is justly regarded
as one of the trenam-es of the national collection. There Its meritc
are occasional imperfectione in the MS. especially in the ῗὲοῇῗθ·
preface, with which the volume begine, and the writing
is by no means easy to decipher. As in the case of the'
poem of Frithegode‚ tho scribe explains by interlinear
glosses some of the more difficult words in the MS. before
him. His copy however is an exceedingly fair one, and
there is a freshness in the materiale and a vigour in the
style which are exceeding attractive.

The remaining Lives os oswald will follow in the 1³19? Μ*
second volume of this collection, in the preface to which aesm-
eome use will be made of the historical materiale with 5¹¹8 Lives

which this biography aboundS. &aad
