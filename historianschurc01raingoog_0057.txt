had just cause to include wilfrid among the saints and
patrous of their monastery.

A. MS. Arundel 91, ff. 125b-144, a fine volume in MSS. of
folio, in double column, written in the beginning of the ξῇἶῖξὴ
twelsth oentury, It is prepared with unusual care and wilfrid.
oontains some nioely illuminated letters. This book, ·
which runs to 228 folioS, is a Lectionary. In addition
to the Life of wilfrid it oontains that of Willebrord.

These are the only two eonnected with the North.

B. MS. (loc, Cambridge, No. 371, ff. 23-78, a noble
volume in 4to contaning 461 folios, very neatly and
uniformly written in a twelfth-oentury hand. It is
devoted to the works of Eadmer, and from an addition
to cap. xlvi. (of. p. 208) probably belonged at one time
to the ehureh of Canterbury. The varied eontents of
this MS. are given with tolerable exaotness in Nasmith's
catalogue of the Corpus MSS. pp. 376-79. When any
collected edition of Eadmer's works is prepared, the
editor must give to this MS. his most earnest attention.

The MS. which was in the possession of the late
Mr. David Laing of Edinburgh passed out of his hands
some years before he died, and he was unable to traoe
it for me. I had once an opportunity of seeing it at
Durham It was a good twelfth-oentury MS. in folio
in double column.
