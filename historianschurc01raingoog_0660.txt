This ia one ot* 1116 many mediaeval chronicles which assume the character of a
history of the world. 11 begins with the creation, and is brought down to the
anthor's own time, the reign of Edward 111. Prefixed to the historical portion, is
a chapter devoted to geography, in which is given a description of every known
land. 'l'o say that the Polychronicon was written in the ἶσαι-16611111 century is to

history and geography which well-informed readers of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries possessed, for it was then the standard work 611 general history.

interesting to the hilologist as instances of semi-Saxonized French.

It is supposed t Peter of Ickham must have been the author, but no certain
conclusion on that point has been arrived at.
