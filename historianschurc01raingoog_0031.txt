Paulinus, but Rum the son of Urien, it is possible that
he was a Briton by birth, and one of the youths from
that country whom Gregory had bought and trained at
Rome to go forth in due time as missionaries to England.

’ On the wall of the monastery of St. Andrew on the

Coelian Hill, justly dear to Englishmen, is an inscription
stating that S. Paulinus, aoechbishop of York‚ had been
an inmate of that house. The history of his progress
and ultimate success at the Nerthumbrian court is too
well-known to be repeated. It is sufficient now to say
that on Easter day, April llth, A.D. 627, Edwin him-
self, with some members of his family, and his nobleS,
was baptized by Paulinus in a chapel or oratory of wood
erected for the occasion in the centre of the old Roman
city of York‚ on a site now occupied, I believe, by the
crypt of the present Minster. · The great monarch began
to enclose this humble edifice at once with a noble church
of stone, to be dedicated to St. Peter. Such was the
beginning of that grand Minster, with its unrivalled
associatione and beauty. Few can pass unmoved into
the crypt and gaze on the remains of earlier stmctures
which carry them back over ten or twelve centuries
of work for God. Here was a chapel dedicated to St.

. , Gregory who sent Paulinus forth. In another peculiar

place is the actual site, if I mistake not, of the font in
which Edwin became a Christian.

After the conversion of Edwin there was a wonderful
influx into the church‚ and Paulinus and his companions
in every part of Edwin's wide domains were quy
occupied in preaching and baptizing. Through Edwin’s
influence East Anglia became Christian as well. And
then Eoforwic became not only the fountain of the
Christianity of the island, but the head-quartem of an
empire which for unity and good government was un-
equalled as yet in the land. The over-lordship of Edwin
reached over the whole of England‚ with the exception
of Kent, to which Edwin himself from deference to the
