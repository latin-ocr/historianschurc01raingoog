The Salis- Β. The Codex Senensis, as Mabillon terms it, which
bury MS. seems to have been found in the cathedral library at
Salisbury by Archbishop Ussher (Acta SS. Ord. S. Ben.‚
ed. Venice, iv, pt. i. 632), and to have been reported by
him to Dr. Gale, who made use of it in his Quindecim
’ Scriptores. Gale says that having given a transcript of ⁴
the ‘Cottonian MS. to Mabillon‚ “ nune eandem ad
“ codicem MS. Sarisburiensem emaculatum et auctam
“ emitt0.” This was in 1691. Mabillon obtained the
additions and various readings which the Salisbury MS.
supplied from Dr. Gale through Professor Bernard.
These Mabillon prints in a subsequent volume. As it is
possible that the MS. may have been misread, Ι have not
given these “ Variantes Lectiones '' in my text of the
Life. Some of them are undoubtedly mistakes ; still,
on the whole, a very large proportion of the readings of
the Salisbury MS„ and among these the most striking,
coincide with those of the Fell MS. at Oxford, and it is,
¹? it iden- Ι think, more than possible that the two are identical.
ἓξὲξ ἔξω Gale's work was published in 1691 in which he mentions
oxford? the Salisbury MS. I have made a diligent search for
it without any success. When Bernard's catalogue of the
MSS. in England and Ireland was published in 1697, it
was not in the Salisbury library. What had become of
it in the interval 2 May it not have been borrowed from
Salisbury by Bishop Fen, for the use of Gale and Bernard,
and have never been returned? The bishop died in
1686, and it may have been sent with the rest of his
MSS. to Bodley’s library. If this conjecture is untenable
the Salisbury and the Fell MSS. must certainly have
been taken from the same original, but as Henry J ones
was the nephew and executor of Bishop Fell, the same
library may not only have the Salisbury MS. but the copy
of it which the bishop caused to be made.
Leland observed a MS. of Eddi's Life in the library at
Glastonbury (collectanea, iv. 154]
