GALENDARS OF STATE PAPERS, διο. >

 

[Iusserat. 8v0.‚ eloth. Price 15⁸. each Volume or Pura]

 

As sar back as the year 1800, a Committee of the House of Commons
recommendati that Indexes and Calendars should be made to the Public
RecordS‚ and thirty-six years afterwards another Committee of the House of
Commons reiterated that recommendation in more forciblo words3 but it
was not until the incorporation of the State Paper Office with the Public
, Record Office that the Master of the Rolls found himself in a position to take
the necessary steps for carrying out the wishes of the House of Commons.

On 7 December 1855, he stated to the Lords of the Treasury that although
‘⁶ the Records, State PaperS, and Documents in his charge constitute the most
“ complete and perfect series of their kind in the civilized world‚’' and
although “they are of the greatest value in a historical and constitutional

“ point of view, yet they are comparatively useless to the public, from the
“ ' want of proper Calendars and Indexes.’'

Acting upon the recommendatione of the Committees of the House of
Commons above referred to, he suggested to the Lords of the Treasury that
to effect the object he had in view it would be necessary for him to employ a
few Persona sully qualified to perform the work which he contemplated.

Their Lordships assented to the necessity of having Calendars prepared
and printed, and empowered the Master of the Rolls to take such steps as
might be necessary for this purpose.

The following Works have been already published under the directio„ of
the Master of the Rolls 2-

Edited by Cainnas Bonnam, Esq„ Secretary of the Public Record
Office. 2 Vols. 1865.

Thi· is a work of great value for elucidating the early history of our nobility
and lauded gontry.
