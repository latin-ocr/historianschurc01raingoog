{2223} Folcard‚ or Fuleard, was a monk in the house of

was. St. Bertin in Flanders, who migrated to Canterbury in

the reign of Edward the Confessor. After the Conquest ⁸

’ King William made him abbot of Thorney‚ but he never
received the benediction on account of some dispute with
the Bishop of Lincoln, and he returned, as some think,
to St. Bertin (Hardy' 6 catalogue, i. 374-5, and 11. 323
Wright's Biogr. Lit„ i. 512-13). In addition to the Life
of St. John, Folcard was also the biographer of SS.
Bertin, Adulf and Botulf, and Oswald.
