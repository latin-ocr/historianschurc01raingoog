only as a mistake, but as little short of 6 6111, 61111 60 to'
destroy its influence, and to put the northern church in
connexion with and in dependence upon the apostolic
see was his mission and endeavour. To the Celtic church
he owed his education and training, 6 fact which he did
not sufficiently remember, especially at Whitby, where
he must have wounded in many ways the sensibilities of
Colman and his friends by his harsh and unseemly
criticisms. To Ecgfiid and other monarchs Wilfrid was
under many obligatione, but he ceased to regard them
as his friends when they thought differently from him-
self. wilfi-id never gave way. He was the last person
in the world to follow Colman's example and to cede
anything. He appealed and struggled, and waited for his
opportunity. If he was completely shut out and could
do nothing, as it was impossible for him to be idle, he
simply went and laboured for God with 6 noble courage
in some other place and country, without losing sight,
however, of his old work and diocese. His great struggle
was so prolonged, and the changes that took place in
Northumbria before it was concluded were so consider-

he was permitted at last to cnjoy 6 fragment of his old
authority. If wilfi-id had only possessed a little of the
tact and consideration of Aidan or Ceadda he might
have done great things, But throughout his life he was
far too careless of the opinions and feelings of others. If
Ecgfrid, who was very amenable to religious influences,
had continued his friend, it is very probable that the
seeds of permanent empire might have been sown in
Nerthumbria. As it was, the two worked apart, and Wil-
frid's zeal for Rome made Ecgfrid the first defender of
the national principle in the English churcg,⁸¹ We may
call him, indeed, the first Protestant. But it is most sad
to think that the strength of tho North was frittered
away over trifleS, when all ought to have been working
