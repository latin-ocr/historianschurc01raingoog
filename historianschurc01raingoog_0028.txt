XX PBEFACE.

The evidences of the existence of Christianity in
Britain, while the island was in the possession of the
Romans, are of a very meagre description as far as
monuments and sculptures are concerned. The sacred
symbol occurs once at York, and twice on objects found
on the line of the Roman wall, and this is all.¹ How
Christianity first reached Britain, and who were its
disseminatorS, it is impossible to say. It probably crept
over from Gaul in the course of the first century after
Christ.= Gaul itself was not· entirely evangelized until
the middle of the third century, and therefore Christi-
anity in Britain, if it existed at all prior to that time,
must have been of the most sparse and meagre kind.
We find traces of it only in the great Roman towns, and
yet Tertullian affirms, about the year AD. 200, that
places in Britain, unvisited as yet by the Romans, had
become subject to Christ. This date brings us into
connexion with Severus, and the “ unvisited places '’ may
have been those districts in the north which he only
partially subdued. In A.D. 314 we have a much
stronger piece of evidence. At the Council of Arles
three British bishops were present, Eborius of York,
Restitutus of London, and Adelphius (probably) of
Lincoln. They are thus connected with the three chief
Roman cities at that time in Britain, and this would
tend to show not merely a spiritual representation of
the natives of the island but of the Romans themselves,
