On 25 July 1822, the House of Commons presented an-address to the
Crown, stating that the editions of the works of our ancient historians were
inconvenient and defective3 that many of their writings still remained in
manuscript, and, in some cases, in a single copy only. They added, ‘⁴ that an
‘⁸ uniform and convenient edition of the whole, published under His Majesty’s
U royal sanction, would be an undertaking honourable to His Majesty’s reign,
“ and conducive to the advancement of historical and constitutional know·
“ ledge3 that the House therefore humbly besought His Majesty‚ that He
“ would be graciously pleased to give such directions as His Majesty‚ in His
“ wisdom, might think fit, for the publication of a complete edition of the
“ ancient historians of this realm‚ and assured His Majesty that whatever
“ expense might be necessary for this purpose would be made goodff’

'lhe Master of the Bolis, being very desirous that effect should be given
to the resolution of the House of Commons, submitted to Her Maiesty' 8
Treasury in 1857 8 plan sor the publication of the ancient chronicles and
memoriale of the United Kingdom, and it was adopted accordingly. In
selecting these works‚ it was considered right, in the first instance, to
give preference to those of which the manuscripts were unique, or the
materiale of which would help to fill up blanks in English history sor
which no satisfactory and authentic information hitherto existed in any
accessible form. One great object the Master of the Rolls had in view was
to form a corpus historicum within reasonable limite, and which should be
as complete as possible. In a subject of so vast a range, it was important
that the historical student should be able to select such volumes as conformed
with his own peculiar tastes and studies, and not be put to the expense os
purchasing the whole collection3 an inconvenience inseparable from any
other plan than that which has been in this instance adopted.

Of the Chronicles and Memoriale, the following volumes have been pub·
lished. They embrace the period from the earliest time of British history
down to the end of the reign of Henry VII.
