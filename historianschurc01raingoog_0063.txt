or 1154 (John of Hexham, sub anno).
To Ketell’s Collection of Miracles there are three Three Ap-

distinct Appendices, each a continuation of the same ξ’(ξῖἓὲξξῗὴ
theme. Liat of

MiracleS.

a. The author professes to supply some of Ketell’s ὁ
omissionS, and to record what he knows by sight or
hearsay: He gives a strange tale of the cure of a deas Incidents
and dumb man in Beverley Minster, whilst Archbishop {xli-333&
Gerard was celebrating mass, The prelate‚ when he Appendix-
heard the news, declared what had happened to the
people‚ and was going to make a long addreSS, when one ·
of his audience quaintly told him that such occurrences
were by no means unusual at Beverley, and that it
would be well if he himself were to pay more respect to
the privileges of a place which had so powerful a saint ’
to protect it.‘ Gerard had probably tried to 01110100,Δ as Arch-
he tried also at York, celibacy among the prebendalieS‚ {geffa-
and to oblige them to reside. The deaf and dumb person
who was cured, lived, we are told, to the end of Thur-
stan’s archiepiscopate, and the writer, when a boy at
school, often saw and talked with him. Thurstan died
in A.D. 1140. In another chapter the writer describes
a deed of wrong wrought in Stephen’s days by Robert Robert de
de Stuteville‚ a great Yorkshire baron, who imprisoned
the son of a citizen of Lincoln in his castle of Gotting-
ham. The youth escaped and got safe to Beverley,
where Alured the sacrist (the historiari), then an old
man, but since deceased, treated him with much kind-
ness.¹ Robert de Stuteville lived to be Sheriff of
Yorkshire‚ A.D. 1169-1175. It is probable, I think,
that this appendix must have been written between
ΑΒ. 1170-80. Another curious story describes a The

an iron -girdle around his body. After visiting St. iron gircue
