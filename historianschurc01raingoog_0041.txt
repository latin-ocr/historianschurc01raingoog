borrowed from 1116 monk of Lindisfarne. Eddi might Δ
have used a stronger word. He had been in wilfi-id’s

his opportunities of observation were considerable.
Then he had at his command 1116 knowledge of abbob
Tathbert, who urged upon him 1116 undertaking of 1116
work. Tathbert was wilfi-id’s kinsman and 0011616111
