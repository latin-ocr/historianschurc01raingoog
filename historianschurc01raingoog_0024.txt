of their coins testifies to their retention of. the place.
We know also that at 13116 beginning of the fifth century
Gaerleon and Chester had ceased to be garrison towns,
and that the sixth was the only legion retained in the
North. This points to the continuance of the military
position of York to the very end. When the old masters

more than anything else, to the weakness of their
assailants. But the invaders were always increasing in
