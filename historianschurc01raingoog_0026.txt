teristic of both races to encourage the form‘ation of little
principalities and chieftaincies. If the division was
made by the Angles it suggests the idea of an occupation
by distinct tribes who made an arrangement between
themselves; indeed, in one point of vieW, the modern
county of Durham, in which there are scarcely any traces
of early post-Roman occupation, may be regarded as a
kind of neutra] territory between the present North-
umberland and Yorkshire, a position which was con-
tinued to it when it became to so large an extent the
patrimony of St. Cuthbert and his successore.

The genealogies appended to N ennius, to which the
date of AD. '737 is ascribed, and which bear traces of
N orthern influence, suggest the time in which the Saxone
became settled in Bernicia' and Deire. Placing the
death of Ida, the first head of the united provinces, in
ΑΒ. 559, and finding seven rulers in each province
before him, by allowing to each generation twenty-five

in the north very close to the period of the departure of
the Romans. When Eburacum, or Oair Ebrauc, which
heads the list of the British cities in this country,2 became
Eoforwic, we do not know. We may observe, however,
that within the last six months a large cemetery of
heathen Angles has been discovered near York, in which
bnrnt bodies were found deposited in urns with accom-
paniments remarkably cognate to the Roman method of =
sepulture. The date of this burial-ground can scarcely
be placed long after the commencement of the sixth
