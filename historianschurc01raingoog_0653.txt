comes down to the year 1292, where it ends abruptly. The history is partien-
lsrly valusble for notiees of events in the eastern portione os the kingdom,
which are not to be elsewhere obtained, and some curions facts are mentioned
relative to the floods in that part of England, which are confirmed in the Fries-
land chronicle of Anthony Heinrich, pastor of the Island of Mohr.

These Poems are perhaps the most interesting of all the historical vritin of
the period, though they cannot be relied on for accuracy of statement. ey
are various in character ς some are upon religione subjects, some may be called
satires, aud some give no more than a court scanda13 but as a whole they pre-
sent a very sair picture of society, and of the relations of the different classes
to one another. The period comprised is in itself interesting, and brings ns,
through the decline of the seudal system, to the beginning of our modern
history. The songs in old English are of considerable value to the philologist.

and Assistant Tutor of Trinity college, Cambridge. 1859.

The author, a monk of Norwich‚ has here given us a chronicle of England
from the arrival of the Saxons in 449 to the year 1298, in or about which year
it appears that he died. The latter portion of this history (the whole of the
reign of Edward 1. more especially) is os great vulne, as the writer was con·

temporary with the events which he records. An Appendix containsseveral
illustrative documenta connected with the previous narrative.

This volume, like all the others in the series containing a miscellaneous selec·
tion of letters, is valuable on account of the light it throws upon biographical

history, and the familiar view it presents of characters, manners, and events.
The period requires much elucidation3 to which it will materially contributa
