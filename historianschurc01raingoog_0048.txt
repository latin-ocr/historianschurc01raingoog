xl PREFAOE.

“ amat3 Graecula verba frequentat, ut, merito dietis ejus
“ aptetur illud Plautinum.
“ Haec quidem praeter Sibyllam leget, nem0.'’1

This exactly describes the pompous and turgid style
of the poem before ue, and it is identical, without doubb,
with that which Eadmer ascribes to the pen of Odo from

odo wrote che quotatione which he makes from it.. Ie ie, Ι think,

ξιξ prefaee plain that Odo merely wrote the prefaee to Frithegode’s
work, which he perhaps also corrected, and that it wenf-
out under hie sanction and authority. Qui facit, per alium,
facit, per se. This ie the opinion of Mabillon and Henry
Wharbon, audit will be no easy matter to gainsay it.

The author calls his work a Breviloqmum and we
may regard it· as a metrical abridgment· of the Life of
wilfrid by Eddi, with a few poetical expansione.

In the sswo MSS. of this poem which have been exa-
mined the name of Frithegode does not appear. Poseibly
it may have occurred in the copy which once belonged to
the German monastery of Corvei, and of which Mabillon

where had the use. The prefaceisprintedbyitselfinwharbon’fl
