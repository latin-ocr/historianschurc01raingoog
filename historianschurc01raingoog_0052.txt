Eacmer Eadmer is the first person after Odo to allude to the
Ξῇξξέζ- translation. At the end of his‘Life of wilfrid (pp. 22⁴1·-
1ation in 226), he describes the bringing away of the relies from

’ to deprive the place which was so dear to Wilffid
altogether of his remains, “ aliquantula pars ab eis cum

“ pulvere tenta, atque in loco convenienti deposita’'
and in his Eadmer alludes to the same event in his life of Arch-
321'332 bishop Oswald„ He speaks of oswald coming to Ripon
and finding the church in ruins. His curiosity made
him search for the remains of the saints interred there,
and he discovers them with the inscription “ Hic re·
“ quiescit Sanctus Wilfredus antistes Eboracensis, et
‘⁶ reverendi abbates Tylbertus, Botwinus, Albertus, Sigre-
“ dus, atque Wildengus.” Eadmer then goes on to say
that Oswald placed Wilffid's body in a shrine because
he was a kinsman of the great wilfrid, and carried it off
to his church of Worcester. He also states that Odo
had previously taken to Canterbury the body of the
elder wilfrid, which had been laid by itself in a more

conspicuous place within the church.
