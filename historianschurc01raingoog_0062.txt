the most of his materials, which were scanty enough.
Foleard‘s He uses of course the few chapters in the fisth book of
2330325‘2& Bede’s Ecclesiastieai History which relate to John,
and to these he adds two or three other miracles.
There is very little of value in the narrative, and the
author seems to have had but a small acquaintance with
history. The work of Folcard ends with the Life, and
consists of only thirteen brief chapters.

Ketell. He was a person of the name of William Ketell, or
Kecell, a clerk of Beverley, who professes to record what
he had either witnessed himself or had heard of from
trustworthy sources, As a whole the miracles are sin-
gularly uninteresting. The collection is dedicated to
two persons whom the author calls Ethel. and Thur„
which possibly represent Ethelred and Thurstin. The
Cottonian MS. omits the dedication and the nameS,
which has the effect of leading the reader to suppose
that Folcard described the miracles as well as wrote the
When Life, which is certainly an error. When did Ketell
‘'mm'‘ compose his work? He quotes Alured of Beverley,
whose Chronicle was written circa A.D. 1150 (pp. 266-8),
and he mentions also St. J ohn’s fomner tomb (p. 272).1
Now we know that there was a translation of St. J ohn’s
remains in A.D. 1197, and we might suppose therefore
from this fact, that Ketell wrote about A.D. 1200. But
a careful examination of 1116 first Appendix necessitates
an earlier date 1111111ι this. We must believe, therefore,
that the word former “ prius '' is an interpolation by a
later writer for the instruction of his readers. In this

case it is not uni-casonable to infer that Ketell wrote his
work about A.D. 1150, and that Thur. is intended for
