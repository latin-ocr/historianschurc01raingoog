⁸ Beda. in his Life of Benedict,
does not allude ιο the separation
between him and wilfrid. It was
probably on account of the halt of
Lyons. Benedict was a servant of
oswiu, and was 25 years old at this
time. cf. H. Ε. V. 19.

⁸ There is a difficulty here. The
Fasti of the church of Lyons ὼν
110 archbishop bearing the name of
DalfinuS. There vae, however, a
prelato of the name of Annemun-
due, who was martyred. Mabillon
says in one place‚.“Dalflnus non
“ alius videtur fuisse ab Anne-
“ mundo. Erat crgo binominis Dal-
“ finus³⁹ (Acta Ord. S. Ben. iv.
637) ; whilst in another place (Ibid.
ii. 744) he identifies Annemund
with sigoberrand, bishop of Paris,

who was 'put to death, which is not
a probable solution of the difficulty.
In Gallia Christiana (iv. coll. 43-
44) is an account of Annemundus
derived chiefly from an old Lyons
Breviary. In it Annemundus, and
Dalfinus count of the city of Lyons.
arc said to be brothers, the sons of
Sigonius and Petronia3 and Anne-²
mundus is naid to have been mar-
tyred, the day of his death being
obscrved in the church of Lyons on
Sept. 28th.

1 am inclined to think this pedi-
gree is correct, and that Eddius has
confused the two brothers. Should
this sur-mise be correct, Annemun·
dus was the archbishop whom Eddi
calls Dalflnus; and it was his nicee,
the daughter of Dalfinus, and there-
fone a wealthy heiress‚ who wan
offered in marriage to Wilffid.
