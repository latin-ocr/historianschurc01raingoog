“Historia Major.” The chronicle here published, nevertheless, gives some
information not to be found in the greater history.

The “Book of llyde ” is a compilation from much earlier sources which ars
usually indicated with considerable care and precision. In many cases, however,
the Hyde chronicler appears to correct, to qualify, or to amplisy—either from
tradition or from sources of information not now discoverable-the statements,
which, in substance, he adopts. He also mentions, and frequently quotes from
writers whose works are either entirely lost or at present known only by fragments.

There is to be found, in the “Book of Hyde,'' much information relating to the
reign of King Alfred which is not known to exist elsewhere. The volume
contains some curicus specimens ot' Angla—Saxon and Mediaeval English.

There ie, in this volume, a legendary account of the peopling of Ireland and of
the adventures which besell the various heroes who arc said to have been con-
nected with Irish history. The details are, however, very uie-agre both for this
period and for the time when history becomes more authentic. The plan adopted
in the chronicle gives the appearance of an accuracy to which the earlier portione
of the work cannot have any claim. The succession of events is marked, year by
year, from aar. 1599 to mn. 1150. The principal events narrated in the later
portion of the work are, the invasions of foreigners, and the wars of the IJish
among themselves. The text has been printed from a MS. preserved in the
librar-y of Trinity College, Dublin, written partly in Latin, partly in Irish.

Itis probable that Pierre de Langtoft was a canon of Bridlington, in Yorkshire,
and that he lived in the reign of Edward 1., and during a portion of the reign of
Edward 11. This chroniele is divided into three parts; in the first ie an
abridgment of Ge‘offrey of Moumouth's “ Historia Britonum,'’ in the second, a
history ot‘ the aglo-Sason and Norman kings, down to the death of Henry 111.,
and in the third a history of the reign of Edward Ι. The principal object of tho
work was apparently to show the ,iustice of Edward’s Scottish wars. 'Ihe
language is singularly corrupt, and a curicus specimen of the Freuch of Yorkshire.

The work in its present form, in the editor’s opinion, is a comparatively modern
version os an undoubtedly ancient original. That it was compiled from contem-
porary materiale has been proved by curicus incidental evidence. It is stated in
the account given of the battle of Clontarf that the full tide in Dublin Bay on the
day os the battle (23 April 1014) coincided with sunrise; and that the returning
tide in the evenlng aided considerably in the defeat of the Danes. The fact has
been verifled by astronomica] calculations, and the inference is that the author of
the chronicle, lf not himself an eye-witness. must have derived his information
from those who were eye-wimesses. The contenta of the work are sufficiently
described in its title. The story is told after the manner of the scandinavian
Sagae, with poems and &agments of poems introduced into the prose narrative.
