VITA WILFRIDI EPISCOPI

Deo ad serviendum pontifici nostro conscripserunt3 et
haee sunt nomina, regionum juxta Rippel,l et in Gae-
dyne,² et in regione Dunutinga‚³ et in antlaevum‚⁴ in

¹ reqionum juxta Rippel] Peter
of Blois, in his missing Life of
wan-id, describes these thus: “ sci-
“ licet Bible, et Hasmundesham, et
‘⁴ Marcheeiae ” (Leland, Con„ ed.
1774, ἰίὶ. 110). By these he seems
to mean Amounderness in North
Lancashire, and the “terra inter
“ Ripham et Mei-sliam '³ (Domes-
day Book), the country between the
Ribblc and the Mersey. This do-
nation will account for the ecclesi-
astical connection of these districts
with the see of York, through the
archdeaconry of Riehmond, which
was maintained until the see of
Chester was founded.

³ in reqione Danuunqa] “in re-
“ gione Duninga” (Peter of Blois).
It is possible that this is Dnuning-
ton near York, an ancient posses-
sion of that cathedral church. But
the connection with the other places
seems to fix it elsewhere. Is this
the country watered by the river
Duddon? 11· so, we shall have
those parts of the archdeaconry of
Riehmondshire which lie in Cum-
berland and Westmerland. Dnd
don-dale is still called Dunnerdalc.

⁴ Caetlaevum] Is this Cartmell in
Laneashire? King Eegfi-id aster-
wards gave “ Cartmel et omnes
“ Britannos ,cum eo’' to St. Cuth-

² in Gaedyne] A friend suggests bert. (Historia de S. cuthberto,

Gedling, co. Notts, but we must
look, 1 think, fai-ther North for a
place about the loculity of which
there is considerable doubt. Until
a more likely place is found, 1
would suggest Gilling, near Rich-
mond, the Ingetlingum where Os-
win was murdered in 651. (Beda,
E. E. iii. 14, and Vita Oswini, ed.
Surtees Soc. 9.) In that place
queen Eanfleda founded a monas-
tery in commemoration of the
mni-dere king, of which Trumhere
was the t abbot, a post which
was subsequently filled by Cym'ffld,
and Tunberht, afterwards bishop of
Hexham. “ (Beda, Η. Ε. iii. 24, and
nist. Abb. Gyrvensiuni, apud Bedae
opp. nist. Minora, 819.)

'trumhere was bishop of Mercia
stom 659 τό 661, and was one of
the Scottish party. It is probable,
therefore, that Gilling was given
over to wilfrid at the sapie time that
he obtained Ripon, or soon aster.

apud Simeonis Dunelm. opp„ ed.
Surtees Soc. i. 141.) We know
that Eegfrid deprived Wilfrid of his
property. In this case he would
assigu a part of it to another
Nerthumbtian bishop, thus assert-
ing his right not only to subdivide
the northern dioceses, but to redis-
tribute their endowments. wilfrid
objected to both of these courses.
should these suggestions be cor·
rect, we have in Rippel, Dnnutinga,
and Caetlaevum the whole of the
western part of the archdeaconry of
Bichmond, of which the ecclesias-
tical control belonged to the church
of York till recent times, although
nearly the whole of the lay fee had
long been lost. And Gilling in
Bichmondshire was the monastery
then nearest to these extensive dis-
tricts, which vere, perhaps, under
the change of the abbot. The reli-
gious house at Cartmell was not
founded until the l2th century.
