his eventful career are well known, and it is unnecessary
to repeat them. He died in AD. 1124. Eadmer took
up Wilfrid's Life as one of the Saints of Canterbury
whose remains had been brought to that place by Od0‚
and translated, on the restoration of the cathedral, by
Lanfranc.

Eadmer, in his prologue and other places, mentions mmet&
the authorities which he had used, i. e. the Ecclesiastical oriti ’ω’
History of Bede, and the metrical life of wilfrid by
Archbis'hop Odo. The only metrical quotations that
can be detected are those from Frithegode's poem,
which he ascribes, evidently, to odo. Eadmer never
mentions Frithegode by name, and is silent also
about the biography by Eddi, although he occasionally
quotes from it. Eadmer was a skilful writer, and could
express clearly in his o'wn words the information that
he borrowed. But he was a very strong partizan of
Canterbury, and never lost an opportunity of putting in
the foremost position and in the best light everything
which tended to advance the dignity and interests of
his church. Of course he makes a hero of Wilfrid. The
-tale which he gives of the doom of Ecgfrid is certainly
damaging to his own reputation as a fair historian.

The most curious point that Eadmer brings out in his Why Ead-
work, nay the very point which prompted him to write mer ''¹⁸⁰²‘'
at all, is the alleged translation of Wilfrid's remains
from Ripon to Oanterbury‚ a matter about which there
has been no little controversy and disputing. The
evidence in favour of the removal begins with the
assertion of the fact by Odo himself in his preface to
Frithegode' s Life. The translation, if it occurred, must Odo says
have taken place before A. D. 959, odo’s death -.γεω 333
There can be no doubt that he would be anxious to wi lffid'ss
rescue from the sacrilege of the Danes, and to placem
within the shelter of his own cathedral‚ the bones of a

great prelate to whom the diocese of Canterbury was
under peculiar obligations.
