PAR‘r II.
i.
”’ The first biographer of wilfrid is a person known by AEdqe, οι·
the name of sadda, Eddi, Eddius, οι· Heddius. He ffssggffl
mentions himself only once in his work (cap. xiv) in a

passage which describes the return of ,wilfrid to N orth-
umbria from Kent‚ in ΑΒ. 669, “ cum cantoribus AEdde

⁸ “ et Eonan.’' Beda records the same fact, adding a

little to the scanty information that we possess, “ Sed
“ et sonos cantandi in ecclesia quos eatenus in Cantia
“ tantum noverant, ab hoc tempore per omnes Anglo-
‘⁸ rum ecclesias discere coeperunt; primusque, excepto
‘⁸ Jacobo de quo supra diximus, cantandi magister
“ Nordanhymbrorum ecclesiis Aeddi cognomento Ste—
“ phanus fuit, invitatus de Cantia a reverentissimo viro
“ wilfi-ido” (H. E. ed: Mayor ssv Lumby, p. 92). We
must regard Stephanus, probably, as a cognomen adopted Called also
when AEdde took the clerical vows. In the preamble to Stephanus.
his biography of Wilfrid he calls himself “ Stephanus

’ “ presbyter ; '’ or, as it seems to have been in the MS.

formerly at Salisbury, ‘⁴ Eddius Stephanus presbyter. ”

AEdde, or Eddi, came, as we see, into the North from Eddi with ⁸

wilfrid,
churcheS‚ and it is probable from the nature of his work ι’Βηίῗιοᾙιιιὶ

Kent to be a choirmaster among the Northumbrian

a that he would only be in occasional attendance upon

his master. From his description of the ecclesiastical
gathering at Austerfield in A.D. '702 (capp. xlvi—vii.) it
is evident that he was present at it, and from his use of
the words “ nos ” and “noster ” it is plain, I think, that
Eddi went with wilfrid on his last journey to Rome.
It is impossible also to read the account of Wilfrid's last
days at Ripon without feeling that Eddi was then in
the monastery. In that place he remained after Wilfrid’s
decease, as he speaks (cap. xvii.) of divers precious gifts
which wilfi-id had made to Ripon remaining there—‘⁸ in
