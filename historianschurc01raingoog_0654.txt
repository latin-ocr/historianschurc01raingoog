about the end of the fourteenth century, consecraoed Bishop of St. Amph in
the year 1444, and translated ιο the see of chichester in 1450. While Bishop of
St. Amph, he zealously defended his brother prelates from the attacks of those
who censured the bishops for their neglect of duty. He maintained that it vas no
part ofabishop’s functione ιο appear in the pulpit, and that his time might be
more profitably spent, and his dignity better maintained, in the performance of
ποι-1η of a higher character. Among those who thought differently vere the
Lollards, and against their general doctrines the ‘⁴ Repressor” is directed. Pecock
took up a position midway between that of the Roman Church and that of the
modern Anglican Church; but his work is interesting chiefly because it gives a
full account of the views of the Lollards and of the arguments by which they were
supported. and beeauoe it assists us to aseertain the state of feeling which ulti·
mately led to the Reformation. Apart from religious matters, the light thrown upon
contemporaneum history is very small, but the “ Repressor ’⁹ has great value
for the philologist, as it tells us what were the characteristica of the language iu
uae among the cultivated Englishmeu of the fifteenth century. Peoock, though

These 1111111118, which are in Latin, commence in the year 447, and come down
ιο the year 1288. The earlier portion appears to be taken from anIrish Chronicle‚
which was also used by Tigernaeh, and by the compilet of the Annals of Ulster.
During its first century it contains scarcely any-thing relating to Britain, the
earliest direct concurreuce with English history is relative to the mission of
Augustine. Its notice· throughout, though brief, are valuable. The annals
were probably written at St. Davids‚ by Blegewryd, Archdeacon of Llandaff,
the most learned man in his day in all Cymru.

These volumes contain the historical works of Gerald du Barry, who lived
in the reigns of Η 11., Richard 1., and John, and attempted to re-establish
the independence of ales by restoring the see of St. Davids to its ancient
primaey. His works are of a very miscellaneous nature, both in prose and
verse, and are remarkable chiefly for the racy and original anecdotes which
they contain relating to contemporaries. He is the only Welsh writer of any

a tone. His frequent travels in Italy, in France, in reland, and in Wales, gave
him opportunities for observation which did not generally fall ιο the lot of medioeral
writers in the twelsth and thirteenth centuries, and of these observatione Giraldus
has made due use. Only extracts from these treatises have been printed before,
and almost all of them are taken from unique manuscripts.

The To graphia Hiberuica (in Vol. V.) is the result of Giraldus’ tvo visits to
Ireland. &he first in the year 1188, the second in 1185-6, when he accompauied

of this treatise is devoted to the animala of Ireland. It shows that he vas a very
