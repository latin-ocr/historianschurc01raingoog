men had been extended to the field of theology, and they appear both in the
writings os wycliff and in those of his adversaries. Wycliff‘s little bundles
of tates are not less metaffliysieal than theological, and the conflict between
N ominalists and Realists rages side by side with the conflict between the different ·
interpretem ot' Scripture. The work gives a good idea of the controversies at

the end of the l4th and the beginning of the l5th centul-ies.

This is a metrical translation of a Latin Prose Chronicle, and was written in the
first half of the leth century. The narrative begins with the earliest legentis,-
and ends with the death of James 1. ot* scotland, and the “ evil ending of the
traitors that slew him.” Strict accuracy of statement is not to be looked for in
such a work as this ς but the stories of the colonization of Spain, Ireland, and
Scotland are interesting if not true ς and the chronicle is valuable as a reflection

of the manners, sentimenta, and character of the age in which it was composed. .

The peculiarities of the Scottish dialect are well illustrated in this metrica] version,
and the student of language vill find ample materiale for compar-ison with the
English dialects of the same period, and with modern lowland Seotch.

This work is dedicated to IIenry VI. of England, who appears to have been, in
the author’s estimation, the greatest of all the Henries. It is divided into three
distinct parts, each having its own separate dedication. The first part relates only
to the history of the Empire‚ and extends from the election of Henry 1., the
Fowler, to the end of the reign of the Emperor Hem-y VI. The second part is
devoted to English history, and extends from the accession of Hem-y 1. in the year
1100, to the year 1446, which was the twenty-fourth year of the reign of King
Hem-y Vl. The third part contains the lives ot‘ illustrious men who have borne
the name of Henry in various parts of the world.

Capgrave was born in 1393, in the reign of Richard Π., and lived during the
, Wars of the Rosos, for the history of which period his work is of some value.
