Necksm vas a inan who devoted himself to science, such as it was in the
tvelsth century. In the “ De Naturis Rerum’' are to be found what may be
called the rudimenta of man sciences mixed up with much error and ignorance.
Necksm was not thought ⁸ 'ble, even by his contemporaries, for Roget Bacon
remarks ofhim,“ thisAlexsnderin many things wrote πωπω true and usefulg
‘⁴ but he neither can nor ought by just title to be rechoned among authorities?
Neckam, however, had sufficient independence of thought to differ stom some
of the schoolmen who in his time considered themselves the only judges of litera-
ture. He had his own viere in moralz, und in giving us a glimpse of them, as
well ss of his other opinions, he throws much hght upon the mannern, castoras,
and general tone of thought prevalent in the twelfth century. Τὶιο poem entitled'
‘⁸ De Laudibus Divinoe Sapientioe ’⁹ appears to be a metn‘cal paraphrese or
abri ent of the “De Naturis Rerum.” It is written in the elegiae ωριτες
and ough there are many lines which violate classiesl rules, it is, as a whole
above the ordinary standard of medioeval Latin.
