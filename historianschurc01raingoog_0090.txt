John Wessington, prior of Dmm,
iu the 15th century, asserts that
this is stamford in Lincolnshire,
which was afterwards given to the
monastery of Durham by William
the Conqueror, and made a cell of
that house. 1f this was the case,

Stamford must have been one of

the possessions of which wilfi-id
was deprived. But Dr. Smith (Beda,
206) states that stanford and Stam-
ford cannot be identical, inasmuch
as Stamford was in Mercia, so that
AIchfrid of Northumbria could not
give it away. He suggests instead

makes it East Tanfield, within a
few miles of Ripou3 but the etymo-
logy of the word seems to forbid
that. It is possible that Stainforth
near Doncaster, ὁι· Stainforth near
Giggleswick, may be the place
referred to.

monastery, which he had given in
the first instance to Bata, abbot of
Melrose. When the Scottish party
refused to give up their anti-catho-
lic views, Alchfrid removed them,
and gave Ripon to Wilfrid. See
