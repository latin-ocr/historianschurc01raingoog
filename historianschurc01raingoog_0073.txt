The text used in the present volume is derived from Whenoe‘

from Rheims sent to England by Mabillon.¹ It was
taken from the MS. at St. Theodoric near Rheims‚ the
scribe having designedly omitted from it ll. 99-1215.
Asterwards another MS. seems to have been discovered
at Rheims itseff, out of which the missing lines (99-1215)
were copied for Gale's benefit, and a few collatione made
in the most imperfect and unsatisfactory way. It is
evident that the text can be improved, but the two
Rheims MSS. cannot be traced‚ having probably dis-
appeared with many 'other literary treasures in the
French Revolution, and we must therefore wait for some
happy day when a new MS. can be discovered. In the
notes to this volume the Codex Remensis is cited as A,
and the Codex S. Theoderici as B.

The last biography in this volume is an unpublished The Ano-
Life of Archbishop Oswald, a work of venerable antiquity ffiffi‘
and interest. In its bearing upon national history it is St. oswald⁸
justly called by Professor Stubbs “ an invaluable and ‘v’ffifin
“ almost unknown evidence for the reign of Edgar and
“ Ethelred.” As to Oswald himself, it is not only the
earliest, but by far the best and most trustworthy account

that we possess.

It is evident that the author must have been a monk 3²23& a'

of Ramsey. He was thoroughly acquainted with the monk of

place and its inmateS, and some of the information which Ramsey
he gives could only have been acquired from Oswald aegffif'
himself. It is observable that he cites Archbishop Elfric

as a witness to the truth of a miracle (p. 452). This

places the date of this biography between AD. 995 and

1005. Oswald died in AD. 992, so that we have in this
