“ Egberti, alium patrem et magistrum Elcbertum, seu
“ AElbertum accepisse sub quo ita eruditione profecit.
“ ut reliquos discipulos sapientia 66 virtute praecelleret3
“ quorum 16111611 propterea. in 66 concitatam invidiam
‘⁴ humilitate 66 mansuetudine ita fregit, ut eum postea

Froben 6166 quotes 1116 words of Rivet‚ in which he

shows that 1116 opinion of Oudin that this poem 16 1116
work of Frithegode‚ 16 untenable on account of the style
and date, and very reasonably concludes “ ex his argu-
“ mentis adeo mihi perspicuum 6666 videtur, Poema
“ pmsens Alcuini genuinum partum 6666, 61, etiam
“ neminem futurum 6666 confidam, cui de 66 16 dubium
“ relinquatur? ,

Α166111 has 1116116 great 666 of Bede in his poem, Aleuin’s
‘quoting not only the Ecclesiastical History largely‚ but agl-xori-
the Metrical Life of Guthbert 66 well. The latter
portion of his work, beginning with l. 1215, 16 by far
the 111661, valuable. His account of the archiepiscopate
under wilfrid Π., Egbert and Albert, 16 of the very
highest interest. Ι1, must be read with the Letters of
the 661116 author, 66 they illustrate each other3 and,
together, they present 6 picture of 611 English minster
in the eighth century which cannot be sul-passed. The
church‚ the library, the school, 611 appear in turn, set off The great
by personal portraits delineated with the most tender mugga·
cure. If we only knew the history of the Ohurch of
York in the ninth and tenth centuries with equal
61166166666, 116 cathedra] in Europe could 116661, of
66 11611 a 6666666166 of noble deeds 61111 illustrious
6166161166.

Oudin, very unjustly 66666166 11116 poem for its rude-' Aleuin’s
11666, and supposes that it 16 on this account the work ⁸³5¹&
of Frithegode. The style 16 entirely dissimilem and
although 1116 verse of that day 16 more or 1666 rugged‚

66 might be expected, we have nevertheless in 11116 poem
66634. f
