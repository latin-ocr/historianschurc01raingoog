time. Folcard had experienced some‘ trouble in the
management of his monastery, and Aldred had given

his own advice and assistance to the perplexed abbot,

and had procured for him the aid os the queen. And

sc, seemingly as a token of his gratitude‚ Folcard under-

takes to write a. life of St. John. He had already, as he

sayra, written some Responsoria in his honour at the
Archbishop's request, and now he goes a little farther

, and essays the story of his life. Aldred was greatly areh-
interested in the ohumh of samby, which St. John ffigssg’ffl„
founded. He had added a presbytery‚ and had rebuilt work at
the whole church westward as far as the great tower of ffigegllssg,
Kinsius. He painted the roof in gorg-eous ecloum, and where.

constructed a rich pulpit of Teutonic work. He likewise

, reformed the staff of the Minster, turning the seven

canonries (the old Culdee number) into prebende, adding
an eighth‚ endowing them, appointing subsidiary vicarS,
and building a common· dormitory and refectory. It
was natural enough, therefore, that such a patron of
Beverley as Aldred had shown himself to be, should be
anxious for the preparation of a. Life of' St. John,
Beverley’s founder and saint. Strange to say, Folcard
never mentions one of these benefactions of Aldred to
Beverley. The special praise which he bestows upon
Aldred is for his getting rid of what he calls the “ prisca
“ rusticitas ’' of the church of York. He mentions
several matters in which the archbishop had made a.
reform, e. 9., in enjoining distinctive dresses for the
clergy in church and at synod, and in ordering a. more
strict observance of almsgiving, washing the feet of the
poor, and the commemoration of the faithful departed.
There was no connexion between these reforma and
Beverley. And yet Folcard must have known that
Aldred had remodelled and endowed the chapter, and
had rebuilt at least one half of the minster.

The style of Folcard is fairly good, better indeed than
that of the majority of our early biographers, He makes
