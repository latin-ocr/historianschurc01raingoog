takes no notice. About the synod at Whitby Bede has
a plethora of information‚ whilst Eddi has but little.
The most pathetic incidente in the account of the evan-
gelization of Sussex we know from Bede only. Still it
is evident that there was but little sympathy between
wilfrid and the great scholar. Bede’s character was not
