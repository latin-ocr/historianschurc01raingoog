This important and unique surrey of the greater ortion of England* is the
'vem It vas commenced

oldest und most valuable record in the national arc
about the year 1084 and fluished in 1086. Its compilation was determined upon
at Gloucester by william the Conqueror, in eouncil‚ in order that he might
know what vas due to him, in the way of tax, from his subJects, and that each
at the same time might know what he had to puy. It vas compiled as much
for their protection as for the beneflt of the sovereign. The nobihty and people
had been grievouely distressed at the time by the king bringing over large num-
bers of Brench and Bretons, and’quartering them on his subjects, “ each accord-
“ ing to the measure of his laud,'' for the purpose of resisting the invasion of
cunt, Kiug of Denmark, which was apprehended. The commissionem appointed
to make the surrey were to inquire the name of each place ς who held it in the
time of King Edward the confession the present possessor; how many hides

. were in the manor ς how many ploughs were in demesne3 how many homagers ς
how many villeins; how many cottars; how many serving men3 how many free
tenants ; how many tenants in soccage ς how much ποσά, meadow, and pasture3
the number of milis and fish-ponds; what had been added or taken away from
tbe place ς what was the gross ralue in the time of Edward the confessor3 the
present value3 and how much each free-man or soc—man had, and whether any
advance could be made in the value. Thus could be ascertained who held the
estate in the time of Kiug Edward3 who then held it ς its value in the time of
the late king3 and its valae as it stood at the formation of the survey. So
minute was the surrey, that the writer of the contemporary portion of the Saxou ·
Chronicle records, with some asperity—“ So very narrovly he caused it to be
“ traced out, that there was not a single hide, nor one virgate of land, nor even,
‘⁴ it is shame to tell, though it wemed to him no shame to do, an ox, nor a σον,
“ nor aswine vas left, that was not set down?
