between A.D. 698 and 705. The Life of the Northern
saint would arouse some literary emulation, and neither
Ripon nor Hexham would like to come short of the
great monastery on the coast of Northumberland. They
3130 had their worthy to commemorate, and bishop Acca
as well 33 abbot Tathbert and his monks were eager
that Wilfrid should have 3 chronicler. They prevail
upon Eddi to take the work in hand. He commences
it by practically borrowing the prologus of the monk of
Lindisfarne‚ merely altering the names. In another
instance (cap. xi.) he gives to his patron, after he became
bishop, the character which had been already ascribed
with far more justice to Cuthbert himself.

reasonable to suppose that he was then not less than
twenty-five years of age. The last event which he
records in the biography is a miraculous appearance

day, which was in A.D. 710. This would make the ’

age of Eddi at that time to be sixty-six. 1 do not
think thatthisLife is ofa much later period. ‚Eddi
omits the epitaph of Wilfrid which Beda gives. Would
he have omitted it if it had been then written? and it

must, 1 think, have been written within a very few years
after Wilfrid’s death.-
